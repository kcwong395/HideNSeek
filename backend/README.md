## Motivation

It is always difficult to transmit messages in an unsecure environment. Some suggest using Encryption while some say steganography. This application is a common type of steganographic skill which allow the user to embed a piece of message into an image. When receiving the image, another user can extract the message back.

To enhance the confidentiality, this tool combines steganography and encryption. A user can insert a key and the tool will encrypt the message before inserting the message into the targeted image.

## Maintenance
