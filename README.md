## Motivation

It is always difficult to transmit messages in an unsecure environment. Some suggest using Encryption while some say steganography. This application is a common type of steganographic skill which allow the user to embed a piece of message into an image. When receiving the image, another user can extract the message back.

TODO: To enhance the confidentiality, this tool combines steganography and encryption. A user can insert a key and the tool will encrypt the message before inserting the message into the targeted image.

## Features

- Confidentiality: all uploaded images will be processed in memory and will never be saved in storage
- Ease of Access: the service is deployed on a cloud platform and no installation required
- Free of Charge: you do not need to pay any fee to use this service
