## Motivation

It is always difficult to transmit messages in an unsecure environment. Some suggest using Encryption while some say steganography. This application is a common type of steganographic skill which allow the user to embed a piece of message into an image. When receiving the image, another user can extract the message back.

To enhance the confidentiality, this tool combines steganography and encryption. A user can insert a key and the tool will encrypt the message before inserting the message into the targeted image.

## Install

Git Clone this project, you should be able to find an exe file in the HideNSeek\bin\Debug folder

Open it and you should be able to see the following interface:

<img src="img_for_readme/cover.PNG" alt="cover icon" />

## Usage

1. Click the Open button
2. Select the image you wish to process (Noted that the tool currently only supports **jpg** and **png** file)

For Senders:

3. Enter the desired content into the text box
4. Click the button **Hide**
5. Send the new image to the receiver(s)

For Receivers:

3. Click the button **Seek**
4. Type the key to decrypt the ciphertext extracted (Ignore this step if encryption is not implemented)
5. The hidden message will be extracted and displayed at the text box

Default mode:

In default mode, no encryption will be implemented.

Encryption mode:

To enable encryption mode, the senders have to type in the key in addition to the message following this syntax:

> \<KEY>key\<ENDKEY>the message you hope to pass
>
> ie. \<KEY>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef\<ENDKEY>pls hide this message for me

On the other hand, the receiver simply needs to input the key without any tags
